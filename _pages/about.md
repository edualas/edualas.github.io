# About me
I am a PhD researcher working on **European extreme events** and their connection to the **Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation (AMOC)**. I am part of the [International Max Planck Research School](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/career/imprs-esm) on Earth System Modelling (**IMPRS-ESM**) at the **[Max Planck Institute for Meterology](https://mpimet.mpg.de/en/homepage)** in Hamburg. I work in the **[Climate Modelling](https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en/workareas/climatemodelling.html)** ([Prof Dr Johanna Baehr](https://www.ifm.uni-hamburg.de/en/institute/staff/baehr.html)) and the **[Climate Extremes](https://www.fnk.uni-hamburg.de/2-research/research-group-climate-extremes.html)** ([Prof Dr Jana Sillmann](https://www.fnk.uni-hamburg.de/2-research/research-group-climate-extremes/team/sillmann-jana.html)) research groups at the **University of Hamburg**.

I completed a MSc in Integrated Climate System Sciences (ICSS) at the University of Hamburg, and a BSc in Physics (Theoretical Physics Track) at the Complutense University of Madrid.
