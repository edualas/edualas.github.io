# About me
I am a PhD researcher working on European extreme events and their connection to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning circulation. I am part of the International Max Planck Research School on Earth System Modelling (IMPR-ESM) at the Max Planck Institute for Meterology in Hamburg. I work in the Climate Modelling (Prof Dr Johanna Baehr) and the Climate Extremes (Prof Dr Jana Sillmann) research groups at the University of Hamburg.

I completed a MSc in Integrated Climate System Sciences (ICSS) at the University of Hamburg, and a BSc in Physics (Theoretical Physics Track) at the Complutense University of Madrid.
